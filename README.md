code for analysis of single neuron reconstructions for the Economo Lab at Boston University

requires .json (check structure of the json as allen changed how they structure it over time, current json functionality only works for recent reconstructions

if not .json, can also use .csv of endpoint frequency of each neuron, can get that through imagej SNT (all new reconstructions i should just be able to do with this)
